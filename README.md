This is code for analyzing the gro/xtc file used in GROMACS, a molecular dynamics simulation program.
In order to use the code, you will need to modify the code name of the molecule or minor numerical settings yourself.

In order to use the code, you will need to modify the code name of the molecule or minor numerical settings yourself.
A brief description of the code is as follows, and all codes were written based on the data file of GROMACS 2021.

modi_atoms_alltime_distrb.py: Code that analyzes the number of interactions of molecules by time in the xtc file.
x.seed_adsp_code.py: Code to calculate the adsorption rate of a molecule to suface over time in the xtc file
pi_pi_interaction_alltime.py: Code that analyzes the number of pi-pi interactions of molecules by time in the xtc file.
water_remove_code.py: Code that removes water molecules below a certain height in the gro file
xseed_density_mixture_0.5A.py: Code that calculates the density of molecules over time in the xtc file
